# 🏦 Bank Loan Report - SQL Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves analyzing a **Bank Loan Dataset** using **SQL (MS SQL Server)** to generate business insights for better decision-making. The goal is to understand loan application trends, assess the performance of loan disbursement, identify good vs bad loans, and evaluate customer profiles. Later, these insights can be visualized using Power BI dashboards.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

To monitor and assess the bank's lending activities and performance, a comprehensive **Bank Loan Report** is generated with the following key goals:

- Track overall loan performance metrics over time
- Compare funded and received amounts
- Segment loans into Good vs Bad based on status
- Analyze borrower characteristics (employment, purpose, region, etc.)
- Provide actionable insights through visual dashboards

## 🔍 Key KPIs & Metrics

### 📊 Summary Dashboard:
- **Total Loan Applications**
- **Total Funded Amount**
- **Total Amount Received**
- **Average Interest Rate**
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**
- Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends for all above metrics

### ✅ Good Loans:
